            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Emma has over 25 years of experience in the fitness industry, working in studios and gyms both in England and abroad. She was introduced to Pilates early in her career and after being convinced of the benefits of this method, chose to train with both Modern Pilates and The Pilates Foundation. Since qualifying she has spent the past 15 years working with clients of all ages and levels of fitness. Her classes offer a wide range of levels and options, therefore ensuring everyone can work at a pace where they feel challenged but comfortable.</p>            
            <p>Created by Joseph Pilates in the 1920's, Pilates is a form of exercise which focuses on core strength, posture, balance and flexibility. Because each exercise can be modified to provide either a gentle strength training program or, a more challenging one, it can be suitable for both beginners and, people who exercise regularly.</p>

            <h1>Current Classes</h1>
            <p>My classes run all year round with the exception of Easter, the month of August and Christmas. All sessions work on a drop-in basis which means you don't have to worry if you need to miss a session. I provide all the equipment you need including mats (though you are welcome to bring your own if you prefer). All classes are held at <a href="http://www.abbotsleigh.org.uk/village-hall/">Abbots Leigh Village Hall</a>.</p>
